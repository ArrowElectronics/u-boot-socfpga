* Synopsys DWC Ethernet 10G Ethernet MAC IP version 2.10 driver (XGMAC)

This binding supports the Synopsys Designware Ethernet 10G Ethernet MAC
IP block. The IP supports multiple options for bus type, clocking and reset
structure, and feature list. Consequently, a number of properties and list
entries in properties are marked as optional, or only required in specific HW
configurations.

Required properties:
- compatible: One of:
  - "intel,socfpga-dwxgmac", "snps,dwxgmac-2.10"
    Represents the IP core when integrated into the Agilex5 Intel (R) SoC FPGA.
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- clocks: Phandle and clock specifiers for each entry in clock-names, in the
  same order. See ../clock/clock-bindings.txt.
- clock-names:
  - stmmaceth

- interrupt-parent: Should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
  that services interrupts for this device
- interrupts: Should contain the core's combined interrupt signal
- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory
- resets: Phandle and reset specifiers for each entry in reset-names, in the
  same order. See ../reset/reset.txt.
- reset-names: May contain any/all of the following depending on the IP
  configuration, in any order:

Optional properties:
- dma-coherent: Present if dma operations are coherent
- mac-address: See ethernet.txt in the same directory
- local-mac-address: See ethernet.txt in the same directory
- phy-reset-gpios: Phandle and specifier for any GPIO used to reset the PHY.
  See ../gpio/gpio.txt.
- phy-handle: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory
- mdio device tree subnode: When the XGMAC has a phy connected to its local
    mdio, there must be device tree subnode with the following
    required properties:
    - compatible: Must be "snps,dwxgmac-mdio".
    - #address-cells: Must be <1>.
    - #size-cells: Must be <0>.

    For each phy on the mdio bus, there must be a node with the following
    fields:

    - reg: phy id used to communicate to phy.
    - device_type: Must be "ethernet-phy".
    - fixed-mode device tree subnode: see fixed-link.txt in the same directory
- altr,sysmgr-syscon: This propertise is a platform specific propertise to
  control the system manager whether to set or reset the XGMAC. This is specific
  to Intel SoC FPGA Family device.

Examples:
gmac0: ethernet@10810000 {
	compatible = "intel,socfpga-dwxgmac", "snps,dwxgmac-2.10", "snps,dwxgmac";
	reg = <0x10810000 0x3500>;
	interrupts = <0 190 4>;
	interrupt-names = "macirq";
	mac-address = [00 00 00 00 00 00];
	resets = <&rst EMAC0_RESET>, <&rst EMAC0_OCP_RESET>;
	reset-names = "stmmaceth", "stmmaceth-ocp";
	tx-fifo-depth = <32768>;
	rx-fifo-depth = <16384>;
	snps,multicast-filter-bins = <256>;
	iommus = <&smmu 0>;
	altr,sysmgr-syscon = <&sysmgr 0x44 0>;
	clocks = <&clkmgr AGILEX5_EMAC0_CLK>;
	clock-names = "stmmaceth";
	status = "disabled";
};
